    <h1>Dragon ball</h1>
    <hr>
   <h2>Risking his life, Goku charges up the Kaio-ken to a triple. The incredible power generated overloads the scouter that Bulma took from Raditz's body and begins to worry King Kai. With newfound strength, Goku ferociously attacks Vegeta. Unable to counter the onslaught, Vegeta is quickly overwhelmed.
 At Kame House, Fortuneteller Baba works hard to conjure up an image on her crystal ball. Although they have no way of telling how well the battle is going for Goku, everyone is excited that Goku's energy is so high, but Master Roshi fears that Goku is pushing himself beyond his limits.</h2>

        The series begins with a young monkey-tailed boy named Goku befriending a teenage girl named Bulma. Together, they go on an adventure to find the seven mystical Dragon Balls (ドラゴンボール), which have the ability to summon the powerful dragon Shenron, who can grant whomever summons him their greatest desire. The journey leads to a confrontation with the shape-shifting pig Oolong, as well as a desert bandit named Yamcha and his companion Pu'ar,<hr> who all later become allies; Chi-Chi, whom Goku unknowingly agrees to marry; and Emperor Pilaf, a blue-skinned imp who seeks the Dragon Balls to fulfill his desire of becoming ruler of the world. Oolong stops Pilaf from using the Dragon Balls by wishing for a pair of panties.

    <h1>Dragon ball Powers</h1>
    <hr>
   <h2>Risking his life, Goku charges up the Kaio-ken to a triple. The incredible power generated overloads the scouter that Bulma took from Raditz's body and begins to worry King Kai. With newfound strength, Goku ferociously attacks Vegeta. Unable to counter the onslaught, Vegeta is quickly overwhelmed.
 At Kame House, Fortuneteller Baba works hard to conjure up an image on her crystal ball. Although they have no way of telling how well the battle is going for Goku, everyone is excited that Goku's energy is so high, but Master Roshi fears that Goku is pushing himself beyond his limits.</h2>

        Steven Simmons, who did the subtitling for Funimation's home video releases, offered commentary on the subtitling from a project and technical standpoint, addressing several concerns.[65][Note 3] Simmons said that Gen Fukunaga did not want any swearing on the discs, but because there was no taboo word list,<br> Simmons would substitute a variation in the strength of the words by situation with the changes starting in episode 21.[66] The typographical errors in the script were caused by dashes and double-quotes failing to appear, which resulted in confusing dialogue.

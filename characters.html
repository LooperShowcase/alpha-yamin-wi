   <h2>Risking his life, Goku charges up the Kaio-ken to a triple. The incredible power generated overloads the scouter that Bulma took from Raditz's body and begins to worry King Kai. With newfound strength, Goku ferociously attacks Vegeta. Unable to counter the onslaught, Vegeta is quickly overwhelmed.
 At Kame House, Fortuneteller Baba works hard to conjure up an image on her crystal ball. Although they have no way of telling how well the battle is going for Goku, everyone is excited that Goku's energy is so high, but Master Roshi fears that Goku is pushing himself beyond his limits.</h2>

 <h1>The anime adaption received generally positive reviews from critics and fans. The first episode was highly praised from initial reactions for its improved quality.[157] Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the series' title sequence and said "My middle-school self is so happy right now, you guys."[158] Jamieson Cox of The Verge also praised the title sequence and said that "Dragon Ball Super's intro will have you begging for its North American release". Cox was also surprised that, considering how popular the franchise is, the series did not launch internationally at the same time. He called it "a move that wouldn't be unprecedented" giving Sailor Moon Crystal as an example.[159]
 The original animation for episode five (left) was widely criticized by viewers and was redrawn for Blu-ray and DVD release (right).However, the fifth episode received harshly negative responses from Japanese and Western audiences due to its poor animation style compared to the previous four episodes
 These problems continued at episode twenty-four, and several more episodes onward.
  Dragon Ball Kai and Resurrection 'F' producer Norihiro Hayashida felt that the criticism was overblown. He said that people were criticizing the entire series based on a few bad sequences that were done by new animators. He went on to explain
a quality decline in the anime industry that he believes is the result of studios cutting time given for post-production and not allowing for reviews of the final product.[160][161][162]</h1>

        The Dragon Ball Z films comprise a total of 15 entries as of 2015. The first 13 films were typically released every March and July during the series' original run by the spring and summer vacations of Japanese schools.<br> They were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. These films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity.<br> All 15 films were licensed in North America by Funimation, and all have
